%% The options are (you can only choose one from each group):
%%
%% 10pt, 11pt, 12pt: chooses the point size for the document. "11pt" is the
%%                   default.
%%
%% oneside, twoside: whether you want your document onesided or twosided. Note
%%                   that twosided is not guaranteed to work, and style
%%                   guidelines prohibit double sided printouts on final
%%                   copy. "oneside" is the default.
%%
%% draft, final: when printing drafts you can save a lot of paper by using the
%%               "draft" option. It switches to single spacing, displays overful
%%               hboxes with a black box, prints a version number on title page 
%%               and omits signature page. Of course for the final copy make
%%               sure to use the "final" option! "final" is the default.
%%
%% thesis, dissertation: switches between the style for a master's thesis and a 
%%                       Ph.D. dissertation. The differences are fairly minor
%%                       and limited to the front matter. "thesis" is the
%%                       default.
%%
%% actual, proposal: switches between actual document and proposal mode. In
%%                   proposal mode: the title page is simplified and the
%%                   version number is always printed.

\begin{abstract}

This is a working abstract and will be finalized when the bulk of the writing has been finished.

Formal verification of cyber-physical systems is challenging because of the complexity of real-world elements interacting with their abstract, data-encoded analogues required for computation.  Several modeling techniques have been introduced... CITE.

This paper extends the concept of Actor Network Procedural Modeling introduced in \cite{ANTs:2011}.

The paper will use ANTs and PDL to model the secure boot process, openflow networking and hardware anti-trojan verification.  All of these processes have cyber-physical elements with strong security requirements.
